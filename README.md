## üìÑ Project Brief

You have two options for your Project Assignment:

Sustainable Food Delivery Webshop

A sustainable food delivery service in Norway connects customers with fresh products from local farms. Customers can browse and order groceries online, with deliveries made directly to their homes from partner farms. The service emphasises sustainability and supporting local agriculture. Now, the company wants to enhance their online presence with a new webshop that highlights their commitment to sustainability while making the ordering process easy and intuitive for customers.

We have created a design of the solution and your task is to implement the design. To download the specification and assets (images) for the project go to this link at this link . Inside you will find a pdf with the specification and a folder containing the Images for the project. Here you can also get your copy of the Figma file.

    A main page that showcases the service and some products
    A product listing page for an overview of available products
    A contact us form users can get in touch
    Integration of a map (via an API) displaying the locations of partner farms
    An AI-powered chatbot for customer service that answers questions about the service and the partner farms

    Task: Create an interactive website for the webshop. You must implement the design provided in Figma, focusing on responsiveness, accessibility, and performance. 

## üöÄ Features - Requirements
Make sure that you clearly understand the Project Assignment Brief and seek clarifications as needed from your teacher. This sets the foundation for your project and ensures you have a clear direction.

You are expected to meet the following requirements for your project:

1. Web Development

    Implement the provided design specification using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
    Create a clear, intuitive user interface following the given design
    Ensure the website is fully responsive across all devices
    Use semantic HTML elements appropriately to structure your content
    Apply CSS flexbox or grid for layout management
    Implement client-side form validation using JavaScript where applicable
    Use ES6+ features and demonstrate understanding of both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms

2. AI Integration

    Integrate an AI-powered chatbot using the OpenAI API
    Implement error handling for API calls and provide appropriate user feedback
    Address AI safety and ethical considerations in your implementation
    Document your use of AI, including any limitations or potential biases

3. API Integration

    Integrate at least one additional third-party API (besides the OpenAI API) into your solution
    Use asynchronous JavaScript (Promises or async/await) for API interactions
    Implement proper error handling and loading states for all API calls

4. Performance and Optimisation

    Ensure fast load times and smooth performance, particularly for AI-powered features
    Optimise your code and assets for performance

5. Accessibility and Web Standards

    Adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for accessibility
    Implement ARIA attributes where necessary
    Ensure full keyboard navigability

6. Version Control and Collaboration

    Use Git for version control with a well-structured commit history
    Host your project on GitHub, using feature branches and pull requests
    Seek at least one code review from another student before submission
    Provide at least one code review for another student's project

7. Documentation and Project Management

    Create a comprehensive README.md file that includes a project description, setup instructions, and usage guide
    Document your development process, including challenges faced and solutions implemented
    Document what resources did you use to update your knowledge to overcome your problems
    Include code comments explaining complex logic and document any key design decisions


## üìÅ File Structure & Resources

Development Tools
    Visual Studio Code or another code editor of your choice for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
